_mkp_ is a super simple file copy program.

_mkp_ copies file(s) based on a template file. By default, _mkp_ tries to find a file named "template" in the current directory. You can provide an environment variable `MKP_TEMPLATE` that points to the template file or provide the path to the template file through the command line interface.

_mkp_ is made for lazy people (like me). I use it mostly when I solve algorithm problems. I simply copy file(s) with a base template and start solving each problem.
